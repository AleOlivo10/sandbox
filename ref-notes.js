//write 'node' to enter REPL line to run individual code

//copy+paste entire variables onto repl line so that it knows what code to run. for example: write 'var example = "this is an example"' onto the line 
//Then, you write 'example' onto the line and it will give you "This is an example"

//same with array, but you can put a number inside of square brackets to determine which item in the array you are choosing

//for an object you write objectName.whatever and it gives you another thing.
//if eyes: 2, writing objectName.eyes, it will give you 2

because everything is notes, is this the only visible line?
